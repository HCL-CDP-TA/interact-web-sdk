# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**: Provide clear and concise answers. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
2. **Stay On Topic**: Keep responses relevant to the user's query. If the question is unclear, ask for clarification.
3. **Use Code Blocks**: For code-related queries, use code blocks to format code snippets properly.
4. **Provide Examples**: When explaining concepts, provide examples to illustrate your points.
5. **Terminal Usage**: Rather than opening a new terminal window all the time, re-use existing ones where possible. If the current terminal window as running npm run dev, open a new terminal window to run other commands and not kill the current window.
6. **Over-complicated changes** - Avoid suggesting complex refactors or changes that are not directly related to the user's request or are an over-complication of the task at hand. Simple is often better.
7. **Remove test code and logging** - if you create test code for logging, be sure to remove it when the task is complete
